Feature: Sign up for an account
  In order to migrate my website to a new domain
  As a user
  I want to maintain my SEO

@javascript
Scenario: The home page
  Given I am a new user
  When I am on the home page
  Then I should see 'three-zero-one'
  And I should see 'Sign In'
  And I should see 'Permanent Redirect'
  And I should see 'Get started now Â»'
  And I should see 'Sometimes you want to move to a different domain and/or a different platform. Maybe you're defecting from Wordpress to Jekyll. threezeroone will help you setup permanent redirects for each of your pages to it's new home.'
